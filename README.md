# MoodleHub
This repository holds our [Lauzhack](http://lauzhack.com/) 2017 Project.

## Concept
MoodleHub was concieved as a way to be able to regularly download and update data from Moodle.

Using this tool enables the user to depend less on an internet connection or a regular authentication, as well as a convenient way to keep yourself updated with your courses (or download all you courses content right before exams !).

## Usage
MoodleHub was developed in Scala, using the Play Framework, Moodle's API, scalaFX and sbt.

If you have sbt you can run the project with it, otherwise we provide a GUI to interact with the tool.

## Features
- Complete personal moodle file download
- Quick and easy retrieveing of file updates
- A simple GUI

## TODO
- A better GUI
- A more intuitive user interaction
- A more complete metadata analysis
- A better handling of tricky cases
